Kaggle House Prices Solution
# Description:

This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle House Prices competition. The project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as the size of the house, the number of rooms, the neighborhood, and more.

# Key Features:

Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Initial analysis of the dataset to understand the data structure and identify any missing or outlier values.
Feature Engineering: Creation of new features that could potentially improve the model's performance.
Model Training and Evaluation: Utilization of CatBoost and XGBoost models for training and evaluation. The models were trained using K-Fold cross-validation to ensure robust performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimentation with different hyperparameters to optimize the models' performance.
Model Combination: Combining predictions from both models using a weighted average to generate the final house price predictions.
